# Weather Risk Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the risk assessment performed on the historical weather dataset (2025). The goal was to categorize flight conditions based on our AI algorithm.

## Summary of Results
* **Total Days Analyzed:** 8
* **Safe Flights (Low Risk):** 4 days (50%)
* **Caution Required (Moderate Risk):** 1 day (12.5%)
* **No-Fly Zone (High Risk):** 3 days (37.5%)

## Key Findings
1.  **High Wind Impact:** Wind speeds above 70 km/h were the primary cause of "High Risk" classification.
2.  **Seasonality:** Winter months showed a 75% higher risk average compared to Summer months.
3.  **Thunderstorms:** Every occurrence of a thunderstorm correctly triggered a "High Risk" alert (Score +4), validating the safety protocol.

## Conclusion
The algorithm successfully flags dangerous conditions. For future improvements, we suggest adding "Snowfall" as a new variable for winter accuracy.
